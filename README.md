In this project, i wanted to implement a Boids simulation and a QuadTree.

You can toggle the QuadTree by pressing ```Q```.

You can also increase the value of the Three Boid's rules by pressing :

  - Alignment  ```A```
  - Cohesion    ```C```
  - Separation  ```S```

> I setup the project only in Qwerty.
